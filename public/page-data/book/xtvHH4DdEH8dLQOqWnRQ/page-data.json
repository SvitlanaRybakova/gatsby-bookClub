A murder trial takes a diabolical turn when the wife of the accused takes the stand. . . . A woman's sixth sense—and a loaded revolver—signal premonitions of doom. . . . A stranded motorist seeks refuge in a remote mansion and is greeted with a dire warning. . . . Detective Hercule Poirot faces his greatest challenge when his services are enlisted—by the victim—in a bizarre locked-room murder.  From the stunning title story (which inspired the classic film thriller) to the rarest gems in detective fiction, these eleven tales of baffling crime and brilliant deduction showcase Agatha Christie at her dazzling best.","title":"The Witness for the Prosecution and Other Stories","id":"xtvHH4DdEH8dLQOqWnRQ","imageUrl":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/book-club-da4cd.appspot.com/o/The-Witness-for-the-Prosecution-and-Other-Stories.jpg?alt=media&token=ddd771ff-75ae-44e9-8921-7388104690d4","author":{"name":"A.
